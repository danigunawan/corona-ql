## API Endpoints

- To return each country(in ascending order) in the db, use the query below. This query includes all the possible fields.

```
query{
  allCountries{
    countryName,
    cases,
    casesToday,
    deaths,
    deathsToday,
    recovered,
    active,
    critical
  }
}
```

- To perform a wildcard search through the records, use the text argument in the countryFilter query.

```
query{
  countryFilter(text: "NIG"){
    countryName,
    deaths
  }
}
```

- The query below will return 10 records starting from the first record. These are also the default values for the per_page and start arguments.

```
query{
  allCountriesLimit(perPage:10, start:1){
    countryName,
    cases,
    casesToday,
    deaths,
    deathsToday,
    recovered,
    active,
    critical
  }
}
```

- To find information about a specific country.

```
query{
  findCountry(countryName: "Nigeria"){
    casesToday,
    deaths,
    deathsToday,
    recovered
  }
}
```

- For a concise summary

```
query{
    summaries{
        totalCases,
        totalDeaths,
        totalRecovered
    }
}
```

- To query this API from a frontend App, make a POST request in the following format. In development, use localhost:3000 instead of the URL below.

```
http://corona-ql.herokuapp.com/graphql?query={ summaries {totalCases, totalDeaths, totalRecovered}}
```
